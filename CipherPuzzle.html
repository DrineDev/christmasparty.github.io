    <p>Solve the problem with a cipher.</p>
    <p>The wind howled outside as Santa sat in his quiet study, holding an ancient scroll sealed with a golden laurel stamp. The parchment bore only a single line of cryptic text:</p>
    <p><b>Btggn Rwgxhibph!</b></p>
    <p>There was no salutation, no sender. Only a brief note scribbled at the bottom: </p>
    <p>“To unlock the gift of time, follow the footsteps of a leader by the river.”</p>
    <p>Santa furrowed his brow. “Time… a leader… the river.” He reached for a dusty book labeled Forgotten Codes of Antiquity. On its first page, the name of a Roman general stood out boldly. "Ah, Julius... it seems you’ve left another challenge.”</p>
    <p>He studied the scroll again. “Fifteen winters past the first day... perhaps that’s the answer,” he mused. Pulling out his trusty cipher wheel, Santa aligned the letters and began to decode.</p>
